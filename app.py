My account email: contact@chebonkelvin.com password: @?Kelvin11468 to understand linkedin user interface on feeds there are three columns, the center one holds inputs at the top to add posts and feeds start from Sort by: Top filter. Posts have white background, there are several post variations. Before I give you variations of posts, posts generally structure is as follows at the top we have elements inline: [image]-[name/companyname]-[message eg 'commented on this']- [3 dots]-[X sign/icon for canceling] next is the profile details person or company posting the post, element are inline[image]-[from top down we have name eg 'Minica Engel +3rd', profile description eg 'Co-founder and managing Partner' time posted eg'1d, 1h' and a globe icon next to it ]-[plus icon and follow text] next post section is post content and from top down here in content we usually have a paragraph maximum 3lines, if a post has more than 3 lines there is a more text like this'...more' this is clickable to reveal more post content for reading, after the paragraph we might have media that is image or video or if someone posted a link we will have link meta descriptions image, title, player. Next post section is elements in line [ icons that represent reactions: likes, love and bulb icon]- [number of comments] final section is of elements inline[like icon with like text not clickable but on hover reaction icons appear you pick like, love or bulb]-[comment icon with comment text onclick a dropdown where posts elongates revealing a form to add comment and below form we have other comments] The post card is clickable meaning it will take you to post detail inside profile account that posted the post, hence no new to click post just clicking â€¦more is enough to reveal posts content and comment or leave a reaction. Now variation one is for comments that are reposted they will have the same structure but repeat this part (profile details person or company posting the post, element are inline[image]-[from top down we have name eg 'Minica Engel +3rd', profile description eg 'Co-founder and managing Partner' time posted eg'1d, 1h' and a globe icon next to it ]-[plus icon and follow text] next post section is post content and from top down here in content we usually have a paragraph maximum 3lines, if a post has more than 3 lines there is a more text like this'...more' this is clickable to reveal more post content for reading, after the paragraph we might have media that is image or video or if someone posted a link we will have link meta descriptions image, title, player. )showing the first person has reposted, based on visuals/ui reposted posts appear to replace the media section.

A post is usually indicated by the name of the person (along with a profile picture) of the person creating the post. This is followed by the post itself.

This paragraph may be one, two, or three lines, not more than three and to read more or show more of the posts paragraph there is a text/link '...more' to reveal more, you click more to read posts content and comment about it based on what is in the paragraph. We also have media that is images and videos, links etc. Some posts repost other posts so you might see two profile details, two paragraphs. Pattern/worst case of  a post sections, for a worst case post we may have sections 1(not in all posts and have this elements in it[image, name, message(eg: 'likes this', 'commented on this', 'reposted this')]), 2(profile info: has or may have image, name, time posted, plus icon and follow text, followers count, profession etc ), 3(paragraph. May be present or not and not a max of three lines, to read more you click '...more link' to show more, this is where you read posts content and what is written about post, ideal you comment on what is here), 4(we may have media-image or video, documents, links), 5(the same for all posts we counters for reactions, comments, repost hope you remember second last section of a postcard),  6(has like and comment remember last post card section and how on click on comment and hovering on like triggers reveal and reaction icons respectively). Meaning for reposts look for such a pattern 1,2, 3(2,3), 4, 5, sometimes 2, 3(2,3), 4, 5, other times 2, (2,3), 4, 5. A post never misses 2. SO even reposted posts you will have 2.
