You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

[39]<div Years ago at the University of Lagos, my best friend and flatmate David Oke and I shared not just a room but dreams of serving God and making an impact through the gospel of Christ. Today, while I've pursued entrepreneurship and investing, David serves as a missionary in The Gambia. I see little difference in what we're called to do ‚Äî be the light that shines the gospel of Christ. This perspective has shaped how I view my entrepreneurial and investment journey as an extension of helping the gospel and grace of Jesus reach as many people as possible.
This is why I'm hosting an Evening of Yoruba Hymns on May 4th at The First Baptist Church Lagos. I chose Yoruba hymns because they represent my first profound connection with theological understanding, offering deep insights into God's nature and His relationship with me as a kid. The venue itself carries historical significance - established in 1855 as a missionary church, funded by supporters from America.
I'll love to see you there and support in raising N100m to support the work of Praise of His Glory Ministry and train more missionaries at The Nigerian Baptist Theological Seminaries.

[60]<div I am honored and grateful for the opportunity to participate in the
Harvard Kennedy School Executive Education
program on Global Leadership and Public Policy for the 21st Century. Over the past couple of weeks, 65 thought leaders from over 40 countries came together to learn from one another and to explore new ways to rebuild societal trust, to restore system stability, and to leverage AI to accelerate positive impacts. Here are some key takeaways from my time at Harvard:
1. Premortem may prove valuable when making high stake decisions. Despite all the noises in the world, leaders should pay attention to things other people don't see. While we are good at leveraging our experience to think fast, intuition sometimes leads us astray due to anchor and/or confirmation bias. We, as leaders, need to zoom out onto the ‚Äúbalcony‚Äù from time to time to evaluate the decisions we are making.
2. Outcomes are not only based on skills, but also on luck. Sometimes, good processes may still lead to bad outcomes.¬†Leaders should focus more on evaluating the quality of the decision process. By focusing on developing strategic alternatives and designing good and fair processes, we will be able to take on smarter risks and improve the odds when making high stake decisions.
3. Transformation leadership is the work of disappointing people at a rate they can tolerate. Leading change requires agitating against a status quo, framing the new vision, and orchestrating the change adoption. When dealing with adaptive challenges, we should listen to and evaluate our stakeholders‚Äô values, their actual and perceived losses, and their loyalty to the cause. We need to raise the heat high enough to reach the point of necessity and the threshold of learning, while keeping the disequilibrium under the limit of tolerance.
4. AI + Me > Me.¬†Generative AI is here to stay.¬†In a world with an abundant of generative AI tools, not using this technology is like not using the internet.¬†The importance of using generative AI effectively is to understand its mistakes and limitations.
5. Finally, while we can do anything, we can‚Äôt do everything. With an increasingly complex world, strategic leadership is less about compensating for weaknesses but more about building on strengths.¬†In addition, empathy and leadership are not trade-offs.¬†With a more human approach, leaders need to use empathy to build trust instead of solely focusing on building confidence.
I look forward to leveraging the insights I have gained from this program to foster innovative solutions as I continue my leadership journey. I also want to specially thank

for organizing this learning experience./>

[85]<div No amount of data, advice, or skills will ever give us absolute certainty.
We could spend our lives analyzing every possible scenario, collecting endless insights, and mimicking proven strategies, yet still find ourselves paralyzed by doubt.
The truth is, certainty is not something we find‚Äîit‚Äôs something we decide. It emerges from a deep trust in our own intuition, forged through action, not endless preparation.
Too often, we seek external validation, chasing after the latest ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù formula for success, hoping it will remove all risk.
We sprint like a rabbit toward the next big answer, only to find ourselves exhausted, lost, and still unsure.
Why?
Because we have trained ourselves to depend on the certainty of others rather than cultivate our own.
But no mentor, book, or trend knows the unique path we are meant to walk.
Our destiny does not unfold through perfect plans; it reveals itself only when we step forward with courage, embracing uncertainty as a part of the process.
It is far better to fail on a journey that is truly ours than to succeed while living as someone else‚Äôs creation.
The most successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and visionaries were not those who followed a perfect blueprint‚Äîthey were the ones who trusted themselves enough to take the leap, even when logic told them to wait.
So, stop waiting for certainty. Choose it. Decide that your belief in yourself is enough. Then take action, because the path ahead will only become clear once you start walking it.
