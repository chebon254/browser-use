You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

 HumanMessage 
Your ultimate task is: """
                Note: I'll use the standard LinkedIn interface screenshot at /home/kibe/Dev/Upwork/linkedin-automation/browser-use/static/uploads/linkedin_interface.png as a reference.
                I'll use my knowledge of LinkedIn's interface to navigate and perform the actions you requested.
                

Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ and comment on posts after reading them, and insert a comment based on their paragraph content, ignore links and hash tag eg #school. After posting a comment, to find more posts scrolling down, comment on 10 posts. My account email: contact@chebonkelvin.com password: @?Kelvin11468 Also ensuree you comment on 3 posts then refresh feed.

Task: Read and comment on LinkedIn posts

1. Navigate to LinkedIn feed: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/

2. For each post:
   - Look for the post content (paragraph text)
   - Click "...more" if available to read the full content
   - Ignore hashtags and links when formulating your comment
   - Write a relevant comment based on the post's text content
   - Click the "Comment" button to submit

3. Comment process:
   - Find the comment section (look for [icon-text(comment)])
   - Click to expand the comment area
   - Type your comment in the input field with placeholder "Add a comment"
   - Click the "Comment" button that appears

4. Continue scrolling to find more posts
   - Comment on a total of 10 posts
   - Skip cards that are recommendations (profile suggestions)

5. How to identify posts:
   - Posts have reaction options at the bottom ([icon-text(like)]-[icon-text(comment)])
   - Posts typically have paragraphs of text (1-3 lines)
   - Posts may include media (images/videos)
   - Some posts may be reposts (showing two profile details)

6. When commenting:
   - Be relevant to the post content
   - If it's a repost, you can address either the original content or both
   - Keep comments thoughtful and professional""". If you achieved your ultimate task, stop everything and use the done action in the next step to complete the task. If not, continue as usual.

For many years the second Green revolution never really took off in the way it was expected. It is getting increasingly difficult to increase yields in all crops with genetic engineering, and only getting marginal gains
So the main focus changed to the introduction of resistances against important diseases that are along abiotic stress the main factors in not reaching yield targets.  But still that is not enough to cover today's needs, even less the real future needs.
So: Why nothing is changing?.  Because we, in developed countries decided that we can meet our needs using our economic power and there is no chance they can compete. A greedy policy to hide the incompetente in managing our resources.
At the end it is causing a constant struggle to meet the needs of many countries, famous examples are the recent wheat shortages due to Ukraine war and bad yields. Or a famous example years ago with the exponencial increase of biofuel destined crops in South Am√©rica that caused quite a hike in prices and avaliability.

good question. Also the 2.1 number is an average and goes up with higher infant mortality, poor health in general, and war so this is likely much higher in many African countries.

[59]<div I dont understand all the hate for vibe coding. Thats just useless gatekeeping from bad developers.
The first home computers used Basic programming language. Apple II, Commodore, Atari, Sinclair. No OS, just boot straight into Basic. Not C. Not assembly. Not Prolog and not Lisp. Not Cobol.
Basic, a simple and easy to use programming language. Typing games from magazines, sent in by other readers, letter by letter, line by line. That was how to become a game programmer (see ID software).
Computers are here to solve problems and do things. LLM's now enable more people to do this. Creating simple games in JavaScript. Creating SQL queries to analyze business data. Using agents to do repetitive data entry on websites.
Coding can still be an art. But that's not its purpose. Its purpose is to get shit done./>

There are a bunch of crucial differences though.
First: when you just hacked something together in BASIC, chances are you weren‚Äôt expecting it to stick around for months or years at a time, growing ever more convoluted as you try to cram more things in (and if you are, at some point you‚Äôre going to hit some criteria that forces you to rethink this)
Second: when you put something together in BASIC, odds are pretty good that your target audience was just you. And if your target audience remains just you, great. Have fun. But if your target audience involves other peoples‚Äô data, anyone‚Äôs money or the possibility of ruining someone‚Äôs day because your thing messed it up for them, it‚Äôs a different proposition entirely.
When the blast radius stops being just you, there is a responsibility and an accountability attached.
If something I wrote causes a loss of data, or a loss of money, that‚Äôs on me. There are consequences for that. That‚Äôs because I am accountable to others for what I do.
Who is accountable for mistakes made by an AI?

accountability doesnt change just because you use AI. If you are a bad coder you will cause problems, if you are a bad AI prompter you will cause problems. If you are bad at implementing security controls you will cause problems.
Any system need to be battletested, and properly risk managed.

No one's gatekeeping. Some of us just dislike AI because of the lies and marketing around it. Even the term AI itself is disingenuous because there is no intelligence in it. People are free to do all the vibe coding they want. Just shouldn't expect themselves to be taken seriously by all of us.

Jose C., your app is not commercial grade, scalable, nor robust.  I‚Äôve never seen it, but I already know.  The best apps were crafted by humans who might collaborate with AI, but humans are in control.
