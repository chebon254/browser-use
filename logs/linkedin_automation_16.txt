You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ and comment on posts after reading them, and insert a comment based on their paragraph content, ignore links and hash tag eg #school. After posting a comment, to find more posts scrolling down, comment on 10 posts. My account email: contact@chebonkelvin.com password: @?Kelvin11468 on linkedin user interface i have attached sample post on image. 

Task: Read and comment on LinkedIn posts

1. Navigate to LinkedIn feed: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/

2. For each post:
   - Look for the post content (paragraph text)
   - Click "...more" if available to read the full content
   - Ignore hashtags and links when formulating your comment
   - Write a relevant comment based on the post's text content
   - Click the "Comment" button to submit

   - Click to expand the comment area
   - Type your comment in the input field with placeholder "Add a comment"
   - Click the "Comment" button that appears

4. Continue scrolling to find more posts
   - Comment on a total of 10 posts
   - Comment on two posts then refresh, then another 2 post till 10 posts
   - Skip cards that are recommendations (profile suggestions)

5. How to identify posts:
   - Posts have reaction options at the bottom ([icon-text(like)]-[icon-text(comment)])
   - Posts typically have paragraphs of text (1-3 lines)
   - Posts may include media (images/videos)
   - Some posts may be reposts (showing two profile details)

6. When commenting:
   - Be relevant to the post content
   - comments should not be more than 60 words
   - If it's a repost, you can address either the original content or both
   - Keep comments thoughtful and professional


""". If you achieved your ultimate task, stop everything and use the done action in the next step to complete the task. If not, continue as usual.

[19]<div No amount of data, advice, or skills will ever give us absolute certainty.
We could spend our lives analyzing every possible scenario, collecting endless insights, and mimicking proven strategies, yet still find ourselves paralyzed by doubt.
The truth is, certainty is not something we find‚Äîit‚Äôs something we decide. It emerges from a deep trust in our own intuition, forged through action, not endless preparation.
Too often, we seek external validation, chasing after the latest ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù formula for success, hoping it will remove all risk.
We sprint like a rabbit toward the next big answer, only to find ourselves exhausted, lost, and still unsure.
Why?
Because we have trained ourselves to depend on the certainty of others rather than cultivate our own.
But no mentor, book, or trend knows the unique path we are meant to walk.
Our destiny does not unfold through perfect plans; it reveals itself only when we step forward with courage, embracing uncertainty as a part of the process.
It is far better to fail on a journey that is truly ours than to succeed while living as someone else‚Äôs creation.
The most successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and visionaries were not those who followed a perfect blueprint‚Äîthey were the ones who trusted themselves enough to take the leap, even when logic told them to wait.
So, stop waiting for certainty. Choose it. Decide that your belief in yourself is enough. Then take action, because the path ahead will only become clear once you start walking it.

Your insight cuts deep, certainty isn‚Äôt discovered‚Äîit‚Äôs chosen. The ancients knew this. The
[72]<a hashtag

taught that courage outweighs control, the
[73]<a hashtag
#
Budha/>
warned that rigid plans break. Yet we still worship data, mistaking maps for terrain.
The truth is no sage, algorithm, or proven method can walk your path for you. Clarity comes from motion, not deliberation.
So leap before you‚Äôre ready. The path appears only to those moving. Doubt is the tax on daring-pay it gladly.

[97]<div Today marks two years since I joined the BBC as Strategic Disability Lead.
I‚Äôve learned a lot in that time - about systems, about leadership, about where the real levers of change are. But more than anything, I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself.
Here are the three biggest things I‚Äôve discovered:
1. I‚Äôm at my best when I lead with honesty.
The more I‚Äôve brought my whole self to the table - including the parts that don‚Äôt always feel polished or comfortable - the more impact I‚Äôve had. People connect to real stories and real people, not perfect policies.
2. I‚Äôm both strategic and personal ‚Äì and that‚Äôs where the magic happens.
Before this role I often felt I had to be either ‚Äúthe disabled voice‚Äù or ‚Äúthe serious strategist‚Äù. Turns out, I‚Äôm most effective when I‚Äôm both. My lived experience fuels my strategy - and my strategy helps make space for other voices too.
3. I‚Äôm not just making space for myself, I‚Äôm reshaping it for others.
This role has shown me just how much influence we can have when we‚Äôre in the right rooms, asking the right questions. What started with my own experience has grown into something much bigger - and that‚Äôs the bit I‚Äôm most proud of.
Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs supported, challenged, and walked alongside me these past two years. Especially
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
and a whole load of other people I‚Äôve just not got room to mention (sorry!).
Working with you all is the highlight of my role at the BBC and I cant wait to see what projects are next.
