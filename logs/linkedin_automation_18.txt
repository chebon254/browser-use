You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

 HumanMessage 
Your ultimate task is: """

                Pay special attention to the structure of posts, the comment sections, and interactive elements.
                

Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ and comment on posts after reading them, and insert a comment based on their paragraph content, ignore links and hash tag eg #school. After posting a comment, to find more posts scrolling down, comment on 10 posts. My account email: contact@chebonkelvin.com password: @?Kelvin11468 on linkedin user interface i have attached sample post on image. 

Task: Read and comment on LinkedIn posts

1. Navigate to LinkedIn feed: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/

2. For each post:
   - Look for the post content (paragraph text)
   - Click "...more" if available to read the full content
   - Ignore hashtags and links when formulating your comment
   - Write a relevant comment based on the post's text content
   - Click the "Comment" button to submit

   - Click the "Comment" button that appears

4. Continue scrolling to find more posts
   - Comment on a total of 10 posts
   - Comment on two posts then refresh, then another 2 post till 10 posts
   - Skip cards that are recommendations (profile suggestions)

5. How to identify posts:
   - Posts have reaction options at the bottom ([icon-text(like)]-[icon-text(comment)])
   - Posts typically have paragraphs of text (1-3 lines)
   - Posts may include media (images/videos)
   - Some posts may be reposts (showing two profile details)

6. When commenting:
   - Be relevant to the post content
   - comments should not be more than 60 words
   - If it's a repost, you can address either the original content or both
   - Keep comments thoughtful and professional


""". If you achieved your ultimate task, stop everything and use the done action in the next step to complete the task. If not, continue as usual.

[27]<div Water, water, everywhere,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink.
Coleridge penned these lines in 1798.
It's 2025 now: no longer poetic lines, but a reality we're confronting frequently.
A young boy in rural India wakes up at 4 AM every day. For what? To fetch water from miles away.
In another corner of the world, a 7 AM scenario: another boy lets the tap run while brushing teeth.
In 1970, the Aral Sea was the fourth-largest lake in the world.
Today, it's a desert.
A chimpanzee, after quenching its thirst, gently wipes the hands of the human who offered it water.
It can be viewed as nature reminding us of the basics: water is sacred. It is life.
Yet nature (wildlife) suffers like they have no right to exist.
Humans continue to deplete natural resources at a rate that nature cannot replenish.
Rivers are diverted for luxury resorts, groundwater is overexploited for industrial farming, all while millions of liters evaporate through leaks, inefficiencies, and mindless habits.
Unfortunately, our careless actions are driving countless species to the edge of survival.
So, what does this all point toward?
Two realities. One planet. Isn't it?
World Water Day celebrated on March 22 every year, aims to inspire action and mobilize efforts to address the global water crisis. So, the key takeaway?
Let's stop treating water like an endless playlist that we keep using until the music stops.
Instead, start respecting it as the lifeline for countless life forms on Earth.

A few days ago ,a news item caught my attention. As a pilot project sort of, a housing society in Ahmedabad, Gujarat cut it's water consumption and the corresponding bill exactly fifty percent. The reason, installation of water meter. When we have to pay, we tend to use that commodity or resource with caution.
It's high time we start with water meters. If we can pay escalating costs of petrol and diesel, with no grumbles as such, water as a life saving fluid needs a better treatment from us.

Ah, that's interesting. Water, often taken for granted, is arguably more precious than fuel, yet its wastage continues unabated.
Pricing water fairly can instill a sense of learning: responsible usage. Also might be the case we humans learn the hard way, what say?
