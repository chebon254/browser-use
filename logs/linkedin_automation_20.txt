You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

 HumanMessage 
Your ultimate task is: """
                Note: I'll use the standard LinkedIn interface screenshot at /home/kibe/Dev/Upwork/linkedin-automation/browser-use/static/uploads/linkedin_interface.png as a reference.
                I'll use my knowledge of LinkedIn's interface to navigate and perform the actions you requested.
                

Go to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ and comment on posts after reading them, and insert a comment based on their paragraph content, ignore links and hash tag eg #school. After posting a comment, to find more posts scrolling down, comment on 10 posts. My account email: contact@chebonkelvin.com password: @?Kelvin11468 Also ensuree you comment on 3 posts then refresh feed.

Task: Read and comment on LinkedIn posts

1. Navigate to LinkedIn feed: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/

2. For each post:
   - Look for the post content (paragraph text)
   - Click "...more" if available to read the full content
   - Ignore hashtags and links when formulating your comment
   - Write a relevant comment based on the post's text content
   - Click the "Comment" button to submit

   - Click the "Comment" button that appears

4. Continue scrolling to find more posts
   - Comment on a total of 10 posts
   - Skip cards that are recommendations (profile suggestions)

5. How to identify posts:
   - Posts have reaction options at the bottom ([icon-text(like)]-[icon-text(comment)])
   - Posts typically have paragraphs of text (1-3 lines)
   - Posts may include media (images/videos)
   - Some posts may be reposts (showing two profile details)

6. When commenting:
   - Be relevant to the post content
   - If it's a repost, you can address either the original content or both
   - Keep comments thoughtful and professional""". If you achieved your ultimate task, stop everything and use the done action in the next step to complete the task. If not, continue as usual.

TIME Earth Awards 2025 Honours the work of Chef Selassie Atadika
Since 2023,

Earth Awards has honoured individuals whose actions have had an indelible

on global efforts to address one of the most pressing crises facing our planet:

#

.  This year, one such honouree is Selassie Atadika.
Just so you understand how big this is,
Selassie Atadika
is honoured alongside

Mike Bloomberg
, actor and co-founder of Climate Basecamp Rainn Wilson, former Governor of Washington State Jay Inslee, chair of the Global Board of the Nature Conservancy and former US Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, and founder of the Centre for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice
Catherine Coleman Flowers
And so it brings me immense, tremendous joy today to celebrate my friend,
Selassie Atadika
. A former client turned friend and turned sister, Selassie is the epitome of 'Knowing'. Knowing who you are, what you are called to do, being laser-focused on it, and sacrificing and enduring throughout that process¬†even as you enjoy and are bolstered by the few high moments that life offers you.
One such high moment is today. Selassie, you are a tremendous professional and an even better person. It's been an honour to watch you live your dream.
For those that think being a chef is simply about cooking, think again. Selassie's art, her calling, is much more than the science of cooking. She is an intellectual powerhouse that works at the intersection of culture, cuisine and the environment. With two Ivy League degrees and a highly successful UN career behind her (and sacrificing all of that to return to Ghana a decade or so ago to start
Midunu
), Selassie has demonstrated what being a Chef is truly about - revering and preserving

, respecting and securing livelihoods in the

In Tchomia, Ituri, a new aquaculture project is transforming lives and offering hope. With 25 floating cages now operational, 53,000 tilapia fry are being raised to support local fish production.
Funded by the UN peacekeeping mission and implemented by the local NGO R√©seau des Associations pour le D√©veloppement Durable (RAD), the project provides several benefits, including:
