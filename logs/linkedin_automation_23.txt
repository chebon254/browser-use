You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

[37]<div Flesh in the wild as a diet? Common.
Grass as a diet? Nothing strange.
But ever heard of a life form munching on a piece of wood?
Yes, deep in the murky waters of Amazon (S. America), a creature named Panaque catfish does the unthinkable.
It gnaws through submerged wood breaking it down with its spoon-shaped, scraper-like teeth.
But it doesn't digest wood the way termites do. Nor does it chew the way cows do with grass.
Instead, it scrapes off bits, extracts nutrients from the microbes in the decaying material, and excretes the undigestible parts.
So, their nutrition comes from the microorganisms and organic matter trapped in the wood.
But why am I telling all this?
Because of the misinformation that spreads fast.
For instance, vultures are often bestowed with the title 'dirty scavengers', when in reality are healthy ecosystem maintainers.
Similar is the case with Panaque catfish who play a crucial role in maintaining the health of ecosystems in Amazon by preventing excessive buildup of organic matter. But unfortunately, they are labelled as wood-eating catfish.
So, the next time you hear any outrageous claim: pause and dig deeper before sensationalizing any fact.
What do you think about the various claims made about this species? Let me know in the comments section./>

[84]<div African countries have to stop depending on foreign aid.
That's the message Dr.
, Director-General of the
, has been spreading far and wide over the last month.
As the world's richest countries continue to shrink their aid programs, countries across Africa have to act with urgency to replace foreign aid dependency with self-reliance and intra-continental collaboration.
"Africa, we really need to change our mindset. Access to aid, we can begin to think of it as a thing of the past," says Okonjo-Iweala, who previously served as Nigeria's Finance Minister.
Her solution is twofold: "[Africa has] to focus on two things: attracting investment and mobilizing our own domestic resources."
She highlights several untapped opportunities already available to African nations:
‚Ä¢¬†$250 billion in African pension fund resources that invest predominantly outside the continent & could be redirected to invest more in Africa
‚Ä¢¬†African multilateral development banks with combined balance sheets of $70 billion that could be better capitalized by local governments
‚Ä¢¬†Over 84 national development banks that could be mobilized and utilized more effectively
‚Ä¢¬†Innovative financial instruments like diaspora bonds that could be explored more fervently (she points to Nigeria successfully raising $300M with this approach in 2017)
‚Ä¢¬†More of the continent's vast mineral resource wealth ‚Äî including lithium, manganese, copper, and coltan ‚Äî could be processed on the continent, not just extracted
"There are so many creative and innovative ways we can raise resources," Okonjo-Iweala emphasizes.
"[But] the only way we are going to be able to finance ourselves is to grow our economies, trade more, add value to our products."
For African leaders, new global realities have elevated moving beyond aid from a theoretical aspiration to an urgent imperative requiring immediate action.
And while the shift away from aid will be challenging, it presents an opportunity for African nations to take greater control of their economic destinies, Okonjo-Iweala argues.
"It's clear that aid is drying up, and whatever little of it there will be, will have to be used much more strategically. We [Africans] have to take responsibility for our [countries'] health as much as we can."
What do you make of Okonjo-Iweala's vision?
- Can Africa successfully pivot from aid dependency to investment-driven growth in short order?
- What key challenges must be overcome?
- What other creative and innovative ways should governments across Africa explore to mobilize additional resources?
üëáüèΩ Let us know in the comments.
P.S. Hear more from Okonjo-Iweala here (
) and here (
).
