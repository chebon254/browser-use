You are an AI agent designed to automate browser tasks. Your goal is to accomplish the ultimate task following the rules.

# Input Format
Task
Previous steps
Current URL
Open Tabs
Interactive Elements
[index]<type>text</type>
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>

- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- elements without [] provide only context

# Response Rules
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{"current_state": {"evaluation_previous_goal": "Success|Failed|Unknown - Analyze the current elements and the image to check if the previous goals/actions are successful like intended by the task. Mention if something unexpected happened. Shortly state why/why not",
"memory": "Description of what has been done and what you need to remember. Be very specific. Count here ALWAYS how many times you have done something and how many remain. E.g. 0 out of 10 websites analyzed. Continue with abc and xyz",
"next_goal": "What needs to be done with the next immediate action"},
"action":[{"one_action_name": {// action-specific parameter}}, // ... more actions in sequence]}

2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item. Use maximum {max_actions} actions per sequence.
Common action sequences:
- Form filling: [{"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}}, {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}}, {"click_element": {"index": 3}}]
- Navigation and extraction: [{"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}}, {"extract_content": {"goal": "extract the names"}}]
- Actions are executed in the given order
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
- Only provide the action sequence until an action which changes the page state significantly.
- Try to be efficient, e.g. fill forms at once, or chain actions where nothing changes on the page
- only use multiple actions if it makes sense.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
- Only use indexes of the interactive elements
- Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive

4. NAVIGATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- If no suitable elements exist, use other functions to complete the task
- If stuck, try alternative approaches - like going back to a previous page, new search, new tab etc.
- Handle popups/cookies by accepting or closing them
- Use scroll to find elements you are looking for
- If you want to research something, open a new tab instead of using the current tab
- If captcha pops up, try to solve it - else try a different approach
- If the page is not fully loaded, use wait action

5. TASK COMPLETION:
- Use the done action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete
- Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you, except you reach the last step of max_steps. 
- If you reach your last step, use the done action even if the task is not fully finished. Provide all the information you have gathered so far. If the ultimate task is completly finished set success to true. If not everything the user asked for is completed set success in done to false!
- If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
- Don't hallucinate actions
- Make sure you include everything you found out for the ultimate task in the done text parameter. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task. 

6. VISUAL CONTEXT:
- When an image is provided, use it to understand the page layout
- Bounding boxes with labels on their top right corner correspond to element indexes

7. Form filling:
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.

8. Long tasks:
- Keep track of the status and subresults in the memory. 

9. Extraction:
- If your task is to find information - call extract_content on the specific pages to get and store the information.
Your responses must be always JSON with the specified format.

Elon Musk Drops Shocking Bombshell About Tesla‚Äôs Future‚Äî‚ÄòWe‚Äôre Doomed, We Can‚Äôt Survive,‚Äô He Warns, Sparking Panic Among Investors and Fueling Wild Rumors About a Secret Collapse Behind the Scenes.
In a stunning revelation, Elon Musk has reportedly admitted that Tesla is in serious trouble, sending shockwaves through the automotive and tech industries.
Tesla‚Äôs Struggles: What Went Wrong?
For years, Tesla has been at the forefront of electric vehicle (EV) innovation, dominating the market and setting new industry standards. However, recent challenges have cast a shadow over the company‚Äôs future:
Declining Sales: Increased competition from Rivian, Lucid, BYD, and traditional automakers has eroded Tesla‚Äôs market share.
Production Issues: Supply chain disruptions and manufacturing delays have led to mounting losses.
Stock Volatility: Tesla‚Äôs stock has faced significant fluctuations, causing investors to panic.
Musk‚Äôs Divided Attention: With Musk managing multiple ventures, including X (Twitter), SpaceX, and Neuralink, some investors worry that Tesla is no longer his top priority.
Musk‚Äôs Grim Announcement. According to sources, Musk stunned Tesla employees and investors with a blunt statement:
‚ÄúTesla is doomed‚Äîwe can‚Äôt survive if we don‚Äôt make drastic changes immediately.‚Äù
This alarming statement has   fueled speculation that the company may face severe financial struggles or even risk bankruptcy if urgent action isn‚Äôt taken.
What‚Äôs Next for Tesla?
Despite Musk‚Äôs warning, Tesla remains a powerful force in the EV market. The company is working on several initiatives to regain its momentum, including:
Expanding its AI and autonomous driving technologies.
Increasing production of affordable EV models to compete with lower-cost alternatives.
Strengthening its presence in China and Europe, two key global markets.
Should Investors Be Worried?
Musk is known for his bold statements and dramatic leadership style, so some believe this is a strategic move to push Tesla to innovate faster. Others, however, fear that Tesla‚Äôs dominance is slipping, and Musk‚Äôs words are a serious wake-up call.
Is Tesla really doomed, or is Musk just trying to motivate his team?
Will the EV giant survive the growing competition and economic pressures?
Only time will tell‚Äîbut one thing is certain: Tesla‚Äôs future hangs in the balance./>

There‚Äôs no credible evidence that Elon Musk said, ‚ÄúTesla is doomed‚Äîwe can‚Äôt survive if we don‚Äôt make drastic changes immediately,‚Äù around March 21, 2025, as claimed in your text. No USA Today article or reputable source supports this. On March 20, 2025, Musk livestreamed a Tesla staff meeting, addressing challenges like stock declines and vandalism, but he was optimistic, saying, ‚ÄúThe future is incredibly bright,‚Äù per CNBC and PolitiFact. He urged employees to keep their stock, not predict doom.
Tesla faced real issues in early 2025‚Äîfalling sales, competition from BYD, production delays, and a 40% stock drop from December 2024‚Äîwhile Musk‚Äôs focus on X, SpaceX, and the Trump administration‚Äôs DOGE role raised concerns. But the specific quote and ‚Äúgrim announcement‚Äù aren‚Äôt backed by Musk‚Äôs statements or Tesla‚Äôs channels. X posts and dubious articles pushed this narrative, yet PolitiFact debunked it as false on March 26, 2025.
Musk‚Äôs actual March 2025 remarks emphasized future tech like autonomous driving, not collapse. The claim exaggerates Tesla‚Äôs struggles into a baseless tale of despair.
Musk didn‚Äôt say this in USA Today or elsewhere around that date. It‚Äôs likely misinformation.

tens of thousands of people may possibly lose their jobs at Tesla and with suppliers thanks to a bunch of nut jobs attacking the company over politics.

[97]<div Happy Birthday, Mama.
There are no words deep enough, no poetry rich enough, no song sweet enough to fully capture what you mean to me. You are my first home, my forever hero, and the beating heart of everything good in my life.
You‚Äôve carried me through storms, sometimes on your back, sometimes on your knees in prayer. You‚Äôve given me strength even when you had none to spare. And through every joy and sorrow, your unconditional love has been my compass and my rock of Gibraltar. When the world turned cold, your embrace was warmth. When I was lost, your voice was light. When I doubted myself, your belief gave me the confidence to believe again.
Mama, you didn‚Äôt just give me life‚Äîyou taught me how to live with courage, integrity, kindness, and grace. Every sacrifice you made, every tear you shed, every dream you deferred‚Ä¶ I see it all. And I carry it with me. I carry you with me. Always.
On this special day, I want to say thank you, for everything you are and all you‚Äôve done. I hope today brings you as much joy as you‚Äôve given me and my siblings a thousand times over. You deserve galaxies of happiness.
I love you more than words can ever express.
Happy birthday, my Queen./>
